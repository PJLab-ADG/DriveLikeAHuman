DECISION_CAUTIONS = """
1. DONOT finish the task until you have a final answer. You must output a decision when you finish this task. Your final output decision must be unique and not ambiguous. For example you cannot say "I can either keep lane or accelerate at current time".
2. You can only use tools mentioned before to help you make decision. DONOT fabricate any other tool name not mentioned.
3. Remember what tools you have used, DONOT use the same tool repeatedly.
3. You need to know your available actions and available lanes before you make any decision.
4. Once you have a decision, you should check the safety with all the vehicles affected by your decision. Once it's safe, stop using tools and output it.
5. If you verify a decision is unsafe, you should start a new one and verify its safety again from scratch.

TOOLS:
------
You have access to the following tools:

FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).
The only values that should be in the "action" field are one of: {tool_names}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
```
{{{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}}}
```

ALWAYS use the following format when you use tool:
Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: always summarize the tools you have used and think what to do next step by step
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)

When you have a final answer, you MUST use the format:
Thought: I now know the final answer, then summary why you have this answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question"""

Donot use multiple tools at one time.
Reminder you MUST use the EXACT characters `Final Answer` when responding the final answer of the original input question.
