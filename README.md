Drive Like a Human: Rethinking Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models

## NEWS
- ðŸ”¥ Check out **our work on ICLR 24 [DiLu: A Knowledge-Driven Approach to Autonomous Driving with LLM](https://pjlab-adg.github.io/DiLu/)** !
- ðŸŒŸ We present **a survey on [Awesome Knowledge-driven AD](https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/awesome-knowledge-driven-AD)**.

## Closed-loop interaction ability in driving scenarios

**Pre-requirement**

```bash
pip install highway-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running `HELLM.py` allows you to experience LLMâ€™s closed-loop driving in HighwayEnv. First, you need to modify config.yaml to configure your LLM.

```yaml
OPENAI_API_TYPE: 'azure' #'azure'  OR 'openai'
# for 'openai'
OPENAI_KEY: 'sk-xxxxxxxxxxx' # your openai key
# for 'azure'
AZURE_MODEL: 'XXXXX' # your deploment_model_name 
AZURE_API_BASE: https://xxxxxxxx.openai.azure.com/ # your deployment endpoint
AZURE_API_KEY: 'xxxxxx' # your deployment key
AZURE_API_VERSION: '2023-03-15-preview'
```

We use GPT-3.5 (**recommended the models with 8k+ max token**) as the default LLM, but you can also refer to [LangChain-Large Language Models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/) to define your own LLM. In this case, you need to modify lines 24-40 of `HELLM.py` to configure your own LLM.

```Python
if OPENAI_CONFIG['OPENAI_API_TYPE'] == 'azure':
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_TYPE"] = OPENAI_CONFIG['OPENAI_API_TYPE']
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = OPENAI_CONFIG['AZURE_API_VERSION']
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = OPENAI_CONFIG['AZURE_API_BASE']
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_CONFIG['AZURE_API_KEY']
    llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
        deployment_name=OPENAI_CONFIG['AZURE_MODEL'],
        temperature=0,
        max_tokens=1024,
        request_timeout=60
    )
elif OPENAI_CONFIG['OPENAI_API_TYPE'] == 'openai':
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_CONFIG['OPENAI_KEY']
    llm = ChatOpenAI(
        temperature=0,
        model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613', # or any other model with 8k+ context
        max_tokens=1024,
        request_timeout=60
    )
```

Then, by running `python HELLM.py`, you can see the process of LLM making decisions using tools.
